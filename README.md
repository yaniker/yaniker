Hi, Iâ€™m Erim Yanik ðŸ‘‹

**About Me**  
Iâ€™m a faculty member at Florida A&M University - Florida State University College of Engineering. I specialize in translating cutting-edge AI research into real-world solutionsâ€”think Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Meta-Learning. I thrive in fast-paced, high-stakes environments, building tools that deliver impact.

**What Iâ€™m Up To**  
Research @ FSU: Crafting AI agents with LLMs on AiMOS (worldâ€™s largest research supercomputer) for real-time OR assessments.
V-CAS Startup: Led development of an end-to-end system for laparoscopic surgery exams. AWS-powered, instant results, 25% cost reduction. Finalist in SAGES global competition.
Past Wins: Built meta-models with 99.9% accuracy on minimal data and cross-view AI for combat medics under a DEVCOM grant.

**Tech Stack**  
Code: Python (9+ yrs), Matlab, Git, Bash (HPC/Slurm)  
ML: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn  
Infra: AWS (S3, EC2), IBM AiMOS, FSU RCC  

**Featured Project**  
[One-Shot Skill Assessment in High Stakes Domains with Limited Data via Meta Learning] (https://github.com/yaniker/One-shot-skill-assessment-in-high-stakes-domains-with-limited-data-via-meta-learning): Meta-learning for high-stakes domainsâ€”99% data reduction, published in Computers in Biology and Medicine (2024).
