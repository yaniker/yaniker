Hi, Iâ€™m Erim Yanik ðŸ‘‹

**Note**  
Having been on an Army Grant, I was not active here until recently. I am releasing some of the methods I have used now as I get the chance.

**About me**  
Iâ€™m a research scientist at FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. I am passionate about solving real life problems where stakes are high and can be costly such as surgery and defense.
