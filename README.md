Hi, Iâ€™m Erim Yanik ðŸ‘‹

Having been on an Army Grant, I was not active here until recently. I am releasing some of the methods I have used now as I get the chance.

**About me**  
Iâ€™m a Generative AI Research Scientist at FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.  
I enjoy solving real life problems.  
I deeply care for trustworthiness, uncertainty, and safety of predictive systems.
