Hi, Iâ€™m Erim Yanik ðŸ‘‹

**Note**  
Having been on an Army Grant, I was not active here until recently. I am releasing some of the methods I have used now as I get the chance.

**About me**  
I develop production-grade AI/ML systems to solve real life problems.  
I deeply care trustworthiness, uncertainty, and safety of predictive systems.
