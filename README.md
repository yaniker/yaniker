Hi, Iâ€™m Erim Yanik ðŸ‘‹

**Note**  
Having worked on an Army Grant, I had to avoid public repositories until recently. I am releasing some of the work I have done now as I get the chance.

**About me**
Iâ€™m a faculty member at Florida A&M University - Florida State University College of Engineering. I am an applied researcher and ML engineer. I am passionate about solving real life problems especially those that endanger human life such as surgery.
